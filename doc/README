This directory contains the Doxygen configuration file,
as well as the developer's documentation (after building it).

The developer's documentation is built using the following
commands:

$doxygen Doxyfile
$cd latex
$make
$cd ..

After this, the documentation of the project
tmpTest will be ready. 

The html version of the documentation can be accessed by
opening the file html/index.html

The pdf version of the document is contained in the file
latex/refman.pdf
